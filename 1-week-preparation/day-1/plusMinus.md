Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=10^{-4}&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=) are acceptable.

Example:

```typescript
arr = [1,1,0,-1,-1];
```
